# Spring Boot REST API Using Spring Data MongoDB Gradle project

I added code to this project to store records in a database. Records will be added to the queue if the database server is unavailable.
There is one scheduler in operation that will save data in the database once the server is up; otherwise, it will wait until the data is saved.

Technologies going to use,

- Java 1.8
- Spring Boot 2.3.4 RELEASE
- Spring Data MongoDB
- Lombok
- Gradle
- IntelliJ Idea for IDE
